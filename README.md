👋 Hi, I’m Darren, originally from Cambodia 🇰🇭, currently residing in Melbourne, Australia 🇦🇺 

I completed my Master of Electrical Engineering (with Business) at the University of Melbourne, which increased my ability to critically examine technical 
problem align with my business perspective including markets, assets, products, planning, procurement and developing engineering management strategies that 
could be a team player to help building a better community.

👨‍💻  Over the course of my studies and experiences in engineering design, data analysis, electrical engineering, I have the following relevant skills and experiences:

• Analytical Skills:  I worked with team members from various backgrounds and expertise I have met for the first time in many data analysis and visualisation 
                      projects alongside innovation and development of dashboards/website, data exploring, extracting, and manipulation. In my final projects 
                      from Monash Data Bootcamp, we developed a web application by using machine learning modelling, python, html, java and tableau to determine 
                      the customer’s credit risk outcome.
                      
• Engineering Design: I worked as an electrical and energy system design engineer for industrial and commercial settings by using various types of computer 
                      software for calculation, modelling and testing. Furthermore, I have done a few research based projects at university related to renewable 
                      energy and power consumption in Cambodia.
                      
In addition to my collaborative experience in a practical environment, I am adept and confident with my communication skills and management expertise. 
I am responsible for handling customer’s complaints and documenting the technical and compliance records as an executive support for the administration. 
Furthermore, my strong written skills and clear verbal skills contributed to me receiving a High Distinction for the final projects at university and bootcamp 
class.

👀 I’m interested in Data and Engineering

🌱 I’m alway up for environmental sustainability and innovative policies

💞️ Open for all possible collaborations.
